## Overview

For my first unassisted html/css project, I decided to try to recreate this design for a QR Code Component. I used CSS Flexbox to put things in place.

## What I learned
Here's the css code I used to center the QR code container.

```css
html, body{
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0px;
    background-color:hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}

#screen{
    height: 100%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items:  center;
}
```
